# Chapter 7: Exercises 1, 2, 3 Solution Calculator

## How to Use
To use the calculator, enter a number, then an operation (+, -, *, /, pow(x,y), sqrt(), %), then another number. 
End the operation with a ";". Always remember to complete your parentheses ( ). 

```bash
> 3 + 4;
= 7
```
To use set variables ,such as x = 5 or y = 2, use the keyword let or the # operation to set a value to your variable name. 
You can use char or underscores _ in your variable name.

```bash
> let x = 5;
= 5
> # y = 2;
= 2
> x + y;
= 7
```

If you want to change the value of your variable, set the variable again to a different value. 
The calculator will prompt you if you want to change the value of the variable (y/n).
If yes, the calculator will allow you to change the value of the variable. 

```bash
> let x = 5;
= 5
> # y = 2;
= 2
> x + y;
= 7
> let x = 3;
= x, declared twice. Reassign? y/n > y
New value of x = 3;
3
> x + y;
= 5
```





To end the calculator, enter "quit" or "exit" to end the program.
```bash
> quit
```

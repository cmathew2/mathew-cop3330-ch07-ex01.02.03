# Chapter 7: Exercises 1, 2, 3 Solution Calculator

## How to Use
To use the calculator, enter a number, then an operation (+, -, *, /, pow(x,y), sqrt(), %), then another number. 
End the operation with a ";". Always remember to complete your parentheses ( ). 

```bash
> 3 + 4;
= 7
```
To use set variables ,such as x = 5 or y = 2, use the keyword let or the # operation to set a value to your variable name. 
You can use char or underscores _ in your variable name.

```bash
> let x = 5;
= 5
> # y = 2;
= 2
> x + y;
= 7
```

Set a variable as a constant with const. The value of a constant cannot be changed after being set. The constants of k, pi, and e are already set.

```bash
> pi;
= 3.14159
> k;
= 1000
> e;
= 2.71828
> const x = 5;
= 5
```

If you want to change the value of your variable, set the variable again to a different value with the "=" operation. (Ex: x = 3)
The calculator will prompt you if are trying to change a constant as you cannot change the value of a constant. 

```bash
> let x = 5;
= 5
> const y = 2;
= 2
> x + y;
= 7
> x = 3;
= 3
> y = 3;
y is a constant. 
> x + y;
= 5
```

To end the calculator, enter "quit" or "exit" to end the program.
```bash
> quit
```
